1.Define software engineering
It is the application of engineering principles to the development operation and maintenance of software.

2 What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to develop,maintain and retire software.It focuses on a comprehensive approach to software development that emphasizes a structured and methodical process to ensure software systems are reliable,scalable and efficient and meet user requirements.
On the other hand traditional programming mainly focuses on writing code to solve a specific problem.It may also not follow a formalized process or methodology as its main emphasis is on the working on the code rather than quality.

3.Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Planning:
Define project goals, scope, and objectives.
Assess feasibility, risks, and resource requirements.
Develop a project plan and schedule.

Requirements Analysis:
Gather and document functional and non-functional requirements.
Engage stakeholders to ensure all needs are captured.
Create detailed requirements specifications.
Design:
Develop the software architecture and high-level design.
Create detailed design for components and interfaces.
Produce design documents and diagrams.

Implementation (Coding):
Write and compile code based on design specifications.
Develop software modules and integrate them.
Follow coding standards and best practices.

Testing:
Conduct various tests (unit, integration, system, acceptance) to identify defects.
Validate that the software meets requirements and functions correctly.
Document and address any issues found.

Deployment:
Release the software to the production environment.
Perform configuration and setup tasks.
Ensure all deployment processes are followed.

Maintenance:
Monitor software performance and address any issues.
Apply updates, patches, and enhancements.
Provide ongoing support to ensure software remains functional and relevant.

All the above phases are often iterative and may overlap depending on the software development methodology.

4 )Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

The Agile and Waterfall models are two prominent approaches to software development, each with distinct characteristics and suitability for different project scenarios.

Differences:

1.Agile: Agile development is an iterative process, where the project is divided into smaller, manageable chunks called sprints. Each sprint involves a cycle of planning, development, testing, and review. This approach allows for flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements.
Waterfall: The Waterfall model follows a linear, sequential approach. Each phase (requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) is completed before moving on to the next one. This approach is more structured and rigid.

2.  -Agile: Agile emphasizes continuous communication and collaboration between stakeholders. Requirements are captured through user stories, which are refined and prioritized throughout the development process. This allows for rapid adaptation to changing requirements.
    Waterfall: In the Waterfall model, requirements are gathered and documented at the beginning of the project. Changes to requirements are difficult and costly to implement later in the process.

3.  Risk Management:
    Agile: Agile's iterative nature allows for early detection and mitigation of risks. Each sprint provides an opportunity to review and adjust the project's progress.
    Waterfall: The Waterfall model is more prone to risks due to its linear structure. Issues discovered late in the process can be costly and time-consuming to fix.

4.  Agile: Agile teams are typically cross-functional and self-organizing. Roles are flexible, and team members collaborate closely.
    Waterfall: In the Waterfall model, roles are more defined and hierarchical. Each phase has a clear owner, and communication between phases is more formalized.

Scenarios and preferences:

1. Agile:
   It is suitable where requirements are dynamic and the software being developed may require constant updating or changing e.g The instagram application.

   It is also suitable where stakeholders are highly involved in the project as their needs may change while they see different sprints of the project and also where rapid prototypes and refinement.

2. Waterfall:
   It is suitable for projects that have well defined requirements or better yet requirements that are fixed before moving forward.

   Regulated Industries: Waterfall is often preferred in regulated industries (e.g., aerospace, healthcare) where strict compliance with standards and procedures is necessary.

   Waterfall is useful when project timelines are critical and must be strictly adhered to.

5.) Modularity in software design refers to the practice of dividing a large software system into smaller, independent, and self-contained modules. Each module is designed to perform a specific function, and these modules are then combined to form the overall software system. This approach improves maintainability and scalability by providing several benefits:
Easier Maintenance:
Modularity: By breaking down the system into smaller modules, it becomes easier to identify and fix bugs, as well as make changes to specific parts of the system without affecting the rest.
Reusability: Modular design allows for the reuse of modules across different parts of the system or even in different projects, reducing the overall development time and cost.
Improved Scalability:
Flexibility: Modular design enables the addition or removal of modules as needed, allowing the system to adapt to changing requirements and scale more efficiently.
Parallel Development: With modular design, multiple modules can be developed and tested independently, allowing for parallel development and faster overal

6.)
Unit Testing:
Definition: Unit testing involves testing individual software components, such as functions, methods, or classes, to ensure they function correctly.
Purpose: It ensures that each unit of code performs as expected, reducing the likelihood of errors and bugs.
Integration Testing:
Definition: Integration testing involves combining multiple software components to ensure they work together seamlessly.
Purpose: It ensures that different components interact correctly and that the system functions as a whole.
System Testing:
Definition: System testing involves testing the entire software system to ensure it meets the required specifications and works as intended.
Purpose: It ensures that the system functions correctly and that all components work together effectively.
Acceptance Testing:
Definition: Acceptance testing involves testing the software system to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.
Purpose: It ensures that the software system meets the requirements and is ready for use by end-users.
Why Testing is Crucial in Software Development
Error Detection: Testing helps detect errors and bugs early in the development process, reducing the overall cost and time required to fix issues.
Quality Assurance: Testing ensures that the software system meets the required specifications and quality standards, ensuring that it is reliable and efficient.

7.)
Version Control Systems (VCSs) are software tools that help manage changes to code, documents, or other digital content over time. They allow multiple developers to collaborate on a project by tracking and managing different versions of the codebase. VCSs provide a centralized repository for storing and managing changes, ensuring that all developers are working with the same version of the code.
Why are VCSs Important in Software Development?
Collaboration: VCSs enable multiple developers to work together on a project, even if they are located remotely. They ensure that all developers are working with the same version of the code, reducing conflicts and errors.
